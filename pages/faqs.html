                    <p>
                        Sometimes our furry friends pick up hitchhikers that
                        make them very itchy and uncomfortable. If gone
                        unchecked, fleas can infest your home, making it even
                        more difficult to rid them from your loved one’s coat.
                        To eliminate fleas, choose a shampoo specially
                        formulated to kill fleas and be sure to read and follow
                        all instructions on the label. Repeat treatment as
                        necessary until your pet is free of fleas; if you see
                        skin irritation, stop use immediately and contact your
                        local vet.

                        The answer can vary widely depending on the type of
                        bird, the size, the environment, and of course, mother
                        nature. Assuming all is well in the external factors
                        that are out of the owner's control, cockatiels and
                        budgies live up to 20 years old on average. However,
                        many parrot variations are known to live nearly an
                        astounding 100 years! As with many living organisms,
                        longevity can be increased by keeping annual
                        veterinarian visits, maintaining a healthy diet, and
                        keeping your feathery friend's environment sanitary.

                    <p>
                        Most snakes eat one to two times per week, depending on
                        their age, size, and activity level. Female snakes often
                        increase their food intake as breeding season gets
                        underway. Some snakes can go as long as two weeks before
                        needing their next meal; this is normal. However, if
                        your snake has not eaten in two or three weeks and seems
                        lethargic, reach out to your local vet to determine if
                        your snake might be ill or injured.
