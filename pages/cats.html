            <p class="intro">
                <b>Cats</b> were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the
                western Asia region and are currently the second most popular
                domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60
                unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between
                breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally
                recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member
                regardless of breed. In this page, you will find more
                information about how to care for your cats throughout the
                various stages of their lives.

                        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a
                        female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly
                        nurse her young if possible. <br />
                        Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its
                        growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is
                        not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need
                        to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a
                        feeding tube.
                        <br /><br />
                        Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
                        appropriately include the following:<br />
                        • Too many other siblings are competing for mom's
                        milk.<br />
                        • Gastrointestinal disease.<br />
                        • Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold,
                        or unsanitary conditions.

                        Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten
                        food typically around three to four weeks after birth.
                        According to the
                        <a
                            href="https://www.aspca.org/"

                            >ASPCS</a
                        >, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry
                        kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per
                        day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a
                        small amount of water can be added to soften the food.
                        Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the
                        additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy,
                        and wellness. <br /><br />Depending on the breed, your
                        cat may have different dietary requirements. You should
                        always consult with your veterinarian for
                        recommendations.

                        This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not
                        need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of
                        activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is
                        not recommended to leave food out for the cats all day.
                        Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat
                        meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This
                        practice reduces the risk of obesity and other
                        weight-related feline ailments.

                        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to
                        deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at
                        this age should eat less fats and calories and more
                        quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
                        packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a
                        particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a
                        category (such as fish). This usually means they are
                        byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
